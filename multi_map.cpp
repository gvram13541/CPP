// Multimap is similar to a map with the addition that multiple elements can have the same keys. 
// Also, it is NOT required that the key-value and mapped value pair have to be unique in this case.
// One important thing to note about multimap is that multimap keeps all the keys in sorted order always. 
// These properties of multimap make it very much useful in competitive programming.

// UNOREDERD_MULTIMAP BEAHVES SAME AS THAT OF UNORDERD_MAP IN ADDITON IT CAN STORE MULTI VALUES I.E REPETIONS ARE ALLOWED.
